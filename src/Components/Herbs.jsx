                <p>
                A human beings are essential parts of nature. 
                Nowadays many of us dismiss this. We try to find 
                ways to bend Nature to our wills with our artificial 
                inventions and modifications to suit our daily needs. 
                We forget the fact that Nature has already provided 
                all the necessary materials to sustain life. This is 
                especially true when it comes to our health. Without a 
                doubt, Western Medicine has reached great success in 
                treating different diseases and helping many people’s 
                lives. However, Traditional Chinese Medicine remedies, 
                whose effectiveness, was proven in practice over 
                thousands of years in ancient China must not be readily 
                disregarded. Even today, many main stream medical care 
                employs TCM and Acupuncture in the treatment of various 
                illnesses. Herbs are a crucial component of Traditional 
                Chinese Medicine. It’s applications has a long standing 
                history and its effectiveness is very much well known. 
                Hippocrates, “the father of Medicine,” himself used more 
                than 200 types of herbs and other natural supplements in 
                his managements of various diseases and illnesses. 
                In today’s society many ordinary people knows about and 
                use medicinal herbs to restore their normal body functions, 
                to optimize their health and to help achieve longevity.
                There was hardly a country in the ancient world, in which 
                its inhabitants did not use herbs or herbal supplements to 
                remedy their health. The Europeans, ancient Greeks, Romans, 
                Kyiv Rus, Indians and mostly notably the Chinese all used 
                herbs to benefit their health. Hence, herbs are most famously 
                identified to as Chinese Herbs. Nowadays Chinese Herbs 
                are gaining more and more popularity as it offers the 
                opportunities for those who are seeking alternative 
                treatment methods, those who are dissatisfied with 
                western medications, or those who seek to avoid the side 
                effects of pharmaceutical drugs. Incidentally, one of 
                the most salient qualities of Chinese Herbs is its low 
                risk of adverse effects and its high tolerance by the 
                human body when used properly.
