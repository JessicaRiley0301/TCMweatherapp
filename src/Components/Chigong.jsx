                    <h4>An Ancient Form of Healing</h4>
                    <p>Qi Gong (pronounced chee gong) is an ancient science in the Chinese Medical 
                        Tradition. For thousands of years, it has been successfully used to maintain 
                        optimum health, treat and prevent disease, alleviate pain and promote 
                        longevity.The key element in Traditional Chinese Medicine is Qi, the Chinese 
                        word for energy or life force. 
                        In a healthy body, Qi flows freely along 
                        invisible paths called meridians. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adverse physical conditions, stress, 
                        or emotional tension may cause blockages or deficiencies of Qi, which 
                        eventually lead to disease.
                        With acupuncture, the doctor inserts sterile, 
                        disposable needles to open the points along the meridians where Qi is obstructed. 
                        The Qi Gong physician uses his ability to manipulate Qi purely with his mind and 
                        breathe. He not only opens the blockages but also fills the meridians with fresh 
                        vital Qi.

                    <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                    <p>
                    Qi Gong is a natural and extremely powerful form of medical 
                    treatment that is painless and has no adverse side effects. 
                    After diagnosing the nature and cause of the patient’s illness, 
                    the doctor clears the body of unhealthy, stagnant Qi. Focusing on 
                    problem areas, he restores flow and balance and then replenishes the 
                    body with fresh and crucial energy. The new energy strengthens the 
                    immune and nervous systems and triggers the bodies own healing powers. 
                    Qi Gong exercises are also taught, which, when practiced consistently, 
                    stimulate your own healing potential. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When done in conjunction with 
                    medical Qi Gong treatments, these practices greatly enhance the effects 
                    of the treatments. This actively involves you in the healing process 
                    and allows you to take charge of your own health. In addition to improving 
                    your physical health, Qi Gong exercises can help you feel more relaxed and 
                    mentally alert, increase your energy and sexual power, 
                    and enhance your creativity. There also is a positive effect on your emotions, 
                    relationships, and even your career. By practicing Qi Gong, you are able to 
                    access your inner strength and work towards reaching your highest potential.

                    Throughout its 1000 year long history, the White Cloud Monastery has been at 
                    the hub of China's cultural development in Daoist philosophy, Traditional 
                    Chinese Medicine, Qi Gong and the martial arts. Advanced Qi Gong practices 
                    were traditionally kept secret, as only initials were allowed to practice the 
                    culmination of a vast esoteric body of knowledge. Dr. Baolin Wu is one of the 
                    highest initiates of the White Cloud Monastery.

                        <h3>9 palaces Qigong</h3>
                        <p>
                        The essence of this ancient Daoist Qi Gong practice from the White Cloud Monastery 
                        is to bring yin and yang together. Man has two halves—one remains in the Universe at 
                        birth. When these two halves come closer through this practice, longevity is achieved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The 9 Palaces practice represents the highest achievement of the ancient Chinese 
                        Daoist tradition of Qi Gong. 9 Palaces is an extremely powerful form comprised of 
                        specialized breathing techniques, movement and visualization, which draws Yang Qi 
                        from the Sun. Qi (chee) is life-force energy, which not only flows through the human 
                        body but through all of nature. The practice is known as the 9 Palaces since its very 
                        specific signals open communication with the 9 levels of Heaven and open all of the 9 
                        palaces of the body, the doors through which the energy of the Sun can enter. This Qi 
                        Gong gathers the solar power in a way much more influential than just being in the sunshine. 
                        The combination of the sunlight and the Qi in the air as you exchange a language of 
                        gestures with the Universe is the best way to replenish your energy and to achieve longevity. 
                        As man consumes himself like a candle, this practice recharges him like a battery.

                        <p>
                        There are 9 degrees to the 9 palaces. The Rainbow Body, a reflection of the highest 
                        aspect of this practice, is how the body becomes Qi when a Master leaves this world. 
                        Dr. Wu witnessed the Rainbow Body of his teacher, Du Dao Zhang, whose body disintegrated 
                        and disappeared in a cloud of red smoke as a ray of ligh t was seen in the direction of 
                        the Sun. Dr. Wu’s teacher told him that if he were to forget everything else, the 9 Palaces 
                        would be the most important knowledge to retain.

                        Her longevity is a direct result of 133 years of persistent practice. 
                        Master Wu took me to visit her on Jan. 2, 2003. During this meeting; 
                        she emphasized the importance of the “Five Centers Facing Heaven”. 
                        She is living proof of this testimony.

                        <h3>Is there any difference between Five Centers Facing 
                            Heaven Qi Gong and other Qi Gong practices?
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                        Five Centers Facing Heaven is a rare and secret practice 
                        from the Dragon Gate and Wu Dang schools of Daoism. It is a 
                        type of Qi Gong, which focuses on the development of direct 
                        communication between the human being and nature by way of Qi. 
                        To practice this special Five Centers Qi Gong is to increase one’s 
                        longevity, deter and avoid most disease and maintain and continue to 
                        improve the physical condition. In one of the most important books 
                        from the Daoist Canon titled “Dao Zang” are accurately recorded 
                        testimonies written by Five Centers practitioners throughout it’s history, 
                        all of which support these claims. In addition, daily practice of the 
                        Five Centers can help one avoid disasters, be large or small, decreasing 
                        the rate of unexpected dangers.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                        It is said, “The essence of Heaven and 
                        Earth produce the human beings body.” In your last life, this life and 
                        your future life, you should meet face to face with plenty of troubles 
                        and disasters because of inherent natural forces as well as the 
                        interaction of the human condition. But this type of Qi Gong can help 
                        you directly affect and change the direction and outcome of such inevitable 
                        occurrences. Other types of Qi Gong do not possess the strength, power and 
                        function, as does the Five Centers Facing Heaven. This is proven by the 
                        historical records of the human being and of course Dr. Wu’s Daoist Aunt 
                        who is currently 140 years of age. This is the best proof of all.
