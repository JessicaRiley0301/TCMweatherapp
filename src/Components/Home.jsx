                                <p>
                                    "Jingzhe" is a seasonal period in traditional Chinese
                                    Medicine that indicates the weather is getting warmer and
                                    the spring time is around the corner. It is at this time, thunder
                                    from rain storms can be heard which wakes up the inects sleeping
                                    underground. Modern meteorology explains that thunder heard
                                    before and after the "Jingzhe" period is due to the increasing
                                    humidity of the earth that cause the rise of hot air near the ground.

                                    During the season of "Jingzhe", the Qi of the liver and Yang of
                                    human body rises gradually and the Yin and the blood are relatively
                                    in decline. It is important to allow the Yang to rise while supporting
                                    the Yin and promoting the blood. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Due to the corresponding relationship between liver and spring time, 
                                    this organ can be weakedn if not properly maintained. From a dietary 
                                    perspective in the season of "Jingzhe", one should harmonize with 
                                    nature by nourishing the liver, splene, and other visceral
