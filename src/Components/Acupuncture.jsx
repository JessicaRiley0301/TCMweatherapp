                    <p>Acupuncture involves the insertion of extremely 
                    thin needles in your skin at strategic points on 
                    your body. Acupuncture originated in China thousands 
                    of years ago, but over the past three decades its 
                    popularity has grown significantly within the United
                    States.Traditional Chinese theory explains acupuncture 
                    as a technique for balancing the flow of energy or life 
                    force — known as qi or chi (chee) — believed to flow 
                    through pathways (meridians) in your body. By inserting 
                    needles into specific points along these meridians, 
                    acupuncture practitioners believe that your energy flow 
                    will re-balance.In contrast, many Western practi tioners 
                    view the acupuncture points as places to stimulate nerves, 
                    muscles and connective tissue. This stimulation appears to 
                    boost the activity of your body's natural painkillers and 
                    increase blood flow.
